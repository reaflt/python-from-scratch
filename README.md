# Python from Scratch

## Overview

**Python from Scratch** is a self‑paced, in‑depth Python curriculum that guides you from first principles through advanced techniques. Organized as a coherent learning roadmap, it combines theory, hands‑on examples, and real‑world projects to develop both conceptual understanding and practical skills needed for professional Python development.

## Content Architecture

### 1. Getting Started  
- Install Python 3.x, configure `venv`, and use the interactive REPL  
- Understand core syntax, primitive data types, and operators  

### 2. Control Flow & Functions  
- Write conditional logic with `if`/`elif`/`else` and loop constructs (`for`, `while`)  
- Define reusable functions, explore parameter passing, return values, scope, and closures  
- Leverage lambda functions, `map`/`filter`/`reduce`, and functional programming idioms  

### 3. Data Structures  
- Master built‑in collections: lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries  
- Create comprehensions and generator expressions for concise, memory‑efficient code  
- Apply advanced iteration patterns and analyze performance characteristics  

### 4. Object‑Oriented Programming  
- Design classes, manage instances, and implement special methods (`__init__`, `__str__`, etc.)  
- Model inheritance hierarchies, method overriding, and polymorphism  
- Encapsulate behavior, apply design patterns (Singleton, Factory, Strategy)  

### 5. File I/O & Error Handling  
- Perform file system operations: read/write text, CSV, JSON, and XML files  
- Structure robust code with `try`/`except` blocks, custom exceptions, and context managers  

### 6. Analytical Ecosystem  
- Use NumPy for vectorized numerical computing  
- Manipulate and analyze data with Pandas DataFrame operations  
- Visualize insights using Matplotlib plots  
- Scrape and parse web data with Requests and BeautifulSoup  

### 7. Web Development Fundamentals  
- Build lightweight web services with Flask: routing, templates, and blueprints  
- Design and consume RESTful APIs, handle JSON payloads, and manage state  

### 8. Quality Assurance & Optimization  
- Adopt test‑driven development with pytest: fixtures, parametrization, and mocks  
- Debug effectively using Python’s debugger (`pdb`) and logging best practices  
- Profile and optimize performance with `cProfile` and algorithmic improvements  

### 9. Capstone Projects  
- Develop an interactive data analytics dashboard integrating Pandas and Matplotlib  
- Create a web scraper that exposes a RESTful API for scraped data  
- Deploy a full‑stack Python application using containerization (Docker)  

## Setup & Prerequisites

1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/reaflt/python-from-scratch.git
   cd python-from-scratch
2. **Create and activate virtual environment**  
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows
3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
